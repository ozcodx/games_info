Between is a pixelated art game for two players by Jason Rohrer.,,
,,
You know exactly what you need to do -- you can see it shimmering right there in front of you. You can see it while dreaming, too, and the difference has become subtle. Dreams wake into dreams, and people blend in and out: real characters and dream characters, all woven into the same script. Finally, they fade completely, and you're alone in the expanse with the construction. With time, you feel something growing, a pinhole that eventually yawns into a deep ravine of longing. The construction languishes, though the expanse seems indifferent.,,
,,
One night, in a dream, they appear: things that you clearly could not have conjured on your own. Not snowflakes. Not the self-similar forms of leaves. Not distant planets' erosion networks as viewed through telescopes. Not those things that are beautifully external but lack the signatures of consciousness. These things that appear are ugly and non-procedural: indecipherable transmissions bubbling up through static, faded messages floating in bottles, and charcoal handprints on cave walls. Evidence has reached you through time of unknown duration and distance of unknown magnitude, but stale evidence is still evidence.,,

,,
Go is an ancient game originated from China, with a definite history of over 3000 years, although there are historians who say that the game was invented more than 4000 years ago. The Chinese call the game Weiqi, other names for Go include Baduk (Korean), Igo (Japanese), and Goe (Taiwanese).,,
,,
In this game, each player tries to exert more influence on territory than her opponent, using threats of death, capture, or isolation. It is, therefore, a symbolic representation of the relationships between nations. Go is getting increasingly popular around the world, especially in Asian, European and American countries, with many worldwide competitions being held.,,
,,
The game of Go is played on a board. The Go set is comprised of the board, together with 181 black and 180 white stones. The standard board has 19 lines by 19 lines, but 13x13 and 9x9 boards can also be used. However, the 9x9 and 13x13 boards are usually for beginners; more advanced players would prefer the traditional 19x19 board.,,
,,
Compared to International Chess and Chinese Chess, Go has far fewer rules. Yet this allowed for all sorts of moves to be played, so Go can be a more intellectually challenging game than the other two types of Chess. Nonetheless, Go is not a difficult game to learn, so have a fun time playing the game with your friends.,,

Amazons is a game played on a 10x10 chess board. Each side has four pieces (amazons) that move like chess queens (in a straight line in any direction). Instead of capturing pieces like in chess, the game is determined based on who moves last.,,
,,
Each move consists of two parts. First an amazon moves to a new square and then fires an arrow to another square (the arrow is fired in a straight line in any direction from the square the amazon landed on). The square the arrow lands on becomes a permenant block for the rest of the game. No one can move over it, or fire an arrow over it. Every turn an amazon must move and fire an arrow, so every turn there is one less square available on the board. Try and block in your opponent or section off a good chunk of the board for yourself.","implemented-in::c, role::program, uitoolkit::gtk, use::gameplaying, x11::application",http://www.yorgalily.org/gamazons/,board,graphical,https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gamazons,https://screenshots.debian.net/package/gamazons,,nan

,,
Gargoyle is based on the standard interpreters for the formats it supports: .taf (Adrift games, played with Scare), .dat (AdvSys), *.agx/.d$$ (AGiliTy), .a3c (Alan3), .asl/.cas (Quest games, played with Geas), .jacl/.j2 (JACL), .l9/.sna (Level 9), .mag (Magnetic), *.saga (Scott Adams Grand Adventures), .gam/.t3 (TADS), *.z1/.z2/.z3/.z4/.z5/.z6/.z7/.z8 (Inform Z-Machine games, played with Frotz, Nitfol or Bocfel), .ulx/.blb/.blorb/.glb/.gblorb (Inform or Superglús games compiled to the Glulxe VM in Blorb archives, played with Git or Glulxe), .zlb, .zblorb (Inform Z-Machine games in Blorb archives, played with Frotz).,,
,,
(note: do not confuse the Git Glux interpreter with the Git DVCS or the GNU Interactive Tools),,
,,
Gargoyle also features graphics, sounds and Unicode support.,,

Technically all the bundled interpreters support the Glk API to manage I/O (keyboard, graphics, sounds, file) in IF games. Gargoyle provides a Glk implementation called garglk that displays texts and images in a graphical Qt window, with care on typography.,,
,,
Limitations:,,
,,
* While Gargoyle can display in-game pictures, it does not provide a way to display the cover art present in some Blorb archives.,,

Go is an ancient game originated from China, with a definite history of over 3000 years, although there are historians who say that the game was invented more than 4000 years ago. The Chinese call the game Weiqi, other names for Go include Baduk (Korean), Igo (Japanese), and Goe (Taiwanese).,,
,,
In this game, each player tries to exert more influence on territory than her opponent, using threats of death, capture, or isolation. It is, therefore, a symbolic representation of the relationships between nations. Go is getting increasingly popular around the world, especially in Asian, European and American countries, with many worldwide competitions being held.,,
,,
The game of Go is played on a board. The Go set is comprised of the board, together with 181 black and 180 white stones. The standard board has 19 lines by 19 lines, but 13x13 and 9x9 boards can also be used. However, the 9x9 and 13x13 boards are usually for beginners; more advanced players would prefer the traditional 19x19 board.,,
,,
Compared to International Chess and Chinese Chess, Go has far fewer rules. Yet this allowed for all sorts of moves to be played, so Go can be a more intellectually challenging game than the other two types of Chess. Nonetheless, Go is not a difficult game to learn, so have a fun time playing the game with your friends.,,

KildClient's ANSI support is extensive: it supports not only the common 16 colors, but also support underlined text (singly and doubly), text in italics, text striked through, reverse video and ""hidden"" text. It also supports vt100's line-drawing characters, and xterm's escape sequences for a 256-color mode. All these features make KildClient one of the clients with the most features for displaying the mud output.,,
,,
Kildclient supports the MCCP (Mud Client Compression Protocol) protocol, versions 1 and 2, to reduce the necessary bandwidth.,,

Netrek is probably the first video game which can accurately be described as a ""sport"".  It has more in common with basketball than with arcade games or Quake.  Its vast and expanding array of tactics and strategies allows for many different play styles; the best players are the ones who think fastest, not necessarily the ones who twitch most effectively.  It can be enjoyed as a twitch game, since the dogfighting system is extremely robust, but the things that really set Netrek apart from other video games are the team and strategic aspects.  Team play is dynamic and varied, with roles constantly changing as the game state changes.  Strategic play is explored in organized league games; after 6+ years of league play, strategies are still being invented and refined.,,
,,
The game was created in 1988, and still has players, including some people who have been playing for nearly as long as the game has existed.",uitoolkit::sdl,https://www.netrek.org,,,https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/netrek-client-cow,https://screenshots.debian.net/package/netrek-client-cow,,nan

polygen,1.0.6.ds2-18,main,generator of random sentences from grammar definitions,"generator of random sentences from grammar definitions,,
PolyGen is a program for generating random sentences according to a grammar definition, that is following custom syntactical and lexical rules.,,
,,
Formally, it is an interpreter of a language itself designed to define languages, where to interpret means executing a source program in real time and eventually outputting its result.,,
,,
Here a source program is a grammar definition, the execution consists in the exploration of such grammar by selecting a random path and the result is the sentence built on the way.,,
,,
Though PolyGen is quite a serious piece of software then, what else would be more noble for it than being used as a parody tool for linguistical habits, stereotypes and trends of this foolish era?,,
,,
Principles of parody are focusing a ridiculous topic and eventually abstracting its rules and schemes (here in terms of a grammar definition) by which reproducing it through the variatio device.

The player places pairs of coloured tiles on a 7x7 grid. Tiles are cleared by surrounding one colour group with another colour group, scoring points. The cleared tiles change the colour of the surrounding colour group, allowing for chain reactions that give more points. More colours are added as more tiles have been placed on the grid and eventually the game will end when the grid fills up.,,

The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need to be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where instead of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities as they become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on their character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of character they play. See the skills help file for details,,
,,
The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has been split  into 4 ""dungeons"", each of which cover a different portion of the dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are actually ""dungeons"" - some are caves, forests, etc.,,
,,
The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very different  magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to undertake a series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer to undertake  the fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice rewards.,,
,,
Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, ""god"" of J.R.R. Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth. Angband is a reference to Morgoth's ""prison of iron.""","role::program, uitoolkit::gtk, uitoolkit::ncurses, uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application",https://github.com/tome2/tome2,rpg,"commandline, graphical",https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/tome,https://screenshots.debian.net/package/tome,,nan

Two features set Transcend apart from other games. First, its dynamic graphical engine, which can smoothly morph from one complex shape to another, produces striking displays. Combining these dynamic shapes with subtle randomizations makes each play through a Transcend level visually different from the last. The second novel feature is Transcend's musical power-up system. As you play through a level, you are simultaneously assembling an abstract visual collage and arranging a unique piece of music.

All actions require Time Units to perform. Once a soldier is out of Time Units, he or she can't do anything more until the next turn.
