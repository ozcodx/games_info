You know exactly what you need to do -- you can see it shimmering right there in front of you. You can see it while dreaming, too, and the difference has become subtle. Dreams wake into dreams, and people blend in and out: real characters and dream characters, all woven into the same script. Finally, they fade completely, and you're alone in the expanse with the construction. With time, you feel something growing, a pinhole that eventually yawns into a deep ravine of longing. The construction languishes, though the expanse seems indifferent.,,
,,
One night, in a dream, they appear: things that you clearly could not have conjured on your own. Not snowflakes. Not the self-similar forms of leaves. Not distant planets' erosion networks as viewed through telescopes. Not those things that are beautifully external but lack the signatures of consciousness. These things that appear are ugly and non-procedural: indecipherable transmissions bubbling up through static, faded messages floating in bottles, and charcoal handprints on cave walls. Evidence has reached you through time of unknown duration and distance of unknown magnitude, but stale evidence is still evidence.,,

,,
Go is an ancient game originated from China, with a definite history of over 3000 years, although there are historians who say that the game was invented more than 4000 years ago. The Chinese call the game Weiqi, other names for Go include Baduk (Korean), Igo (Japanese), and Goe (Taiwanese).,,
,,
In this game, each player tries to exert more influence on territory than her opponent, using threats of death, capture, or isolation. It is, therefore, a symbolic representation of the relationships between nations. Go is getting increasingly popular around the world, especially in Asian, European and American countries, with many worldwide competitions being held.,,
,,
The game of Go is played on a board. The Go set is comprised of the board, together with 181 black and 180 white stones. The standard board has 19 lines by 19 lines, but 13x13 and 9x9 boards can also be used. However, the 9x9 and 13x13 boards are usually for beginners; more advanced players would prefer the traditional 19x19 board.,,
,,
Compared to International Chess and Chinese Chess, Go has far fewer rules. Yet this allowed for all sorts of moves to be played, so Go can be a more intellectually challenging game than the other two types of Chess. Nonetheless, Go is not a difficult game to learn, so have a fun time playing the game with your friends.,,

Amazons is a game played on a 10x10 chess board. Each side has four pieces (amazons) that move like chess queens (in a straight line in any direction). Instead of capturing pieces like in chess, the game is determined based on who moves last.,,
,,
Each move consists of two parts. First an amazon moves to a new square and then fires an arrow to another square (the arrow is fired in a straight line in any direction from the square the amazon landed on). The square the arrow lands on becomes a permenant block for the rest of the game. No one can move over it, or fire an arrow over it. Every turn an amazon must move and fire an arrow, so every turn there is one less square available on the board. Try and block in your opponent or section off a good chunk of the board for yourself.","implemented-in::c, role::program, uitoolkit::gtk, use::gameplaying, x11::application",http://www.yorgalily.org/gamazons/,board,graphical,https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gamazons,https://screenshots.debian.net/package/gamazons,1.0,chess like game

Gargoyle is based on the standard interpreters for the formats it supports: .taf (Adrift games, played with Scare), .dat (AdvSys), *.agx/.d$$ (AGiliTy), .a3c (Alan3), .asl/.cas (Quest games, played with Geas), .jacl/.j2 (JACL), .l9/.sna (Level 9), .mag (Magnetic), *.saga (Scott Adams Grand Adventures), .gam/.t3 (TADS), *.z1/.z2/.z3/.z4/.z5/.z6/.z7/.z8 (Inform Z-Machine games, played with Frotz, Nitfol or Bocfel), .ulx/.blb/.blorb/.glb/.gblorb (Inform or Superglús games compiled to the Glulxe VM in Blorb archives, played with Git or Glulxe), .zlb, .zblorb (Inform Z-Machine games in Blorb archives, played with Frotz).,,
,,
(note: do not confuse the Git Glux interpreter with the Git DVCS or the GNU Interactive Tools),,
,,
Gargoyle also features graphics, sounds and Unicode support.,,

Technically all the bundled interpreters support the Glk API to manage I/O (keyboard, graphics, sounds, file) in IF games. Gargoyle provides a Glk implementation called garglk that displays texts and images in a graphical Qt window, with care on typography.,,
,,
Limitations:,,
,,
* While Gargoyle can display in-game pictures, it does not provide a way to display the cover art present in some Blorb archives.,,

Go is an ancient game originated from China, with a definite history of over 3000 years, although there are historians who say that the game was invented more than 4000 years ago. The Chinese call the game Weiqi, other names for Go include Baduk (Korean), Igo (Japanese), and Goe (Taiwanese).,,
,,
In this game, each player tries to exert more influence on territory than her opponent, using threats of death, capture, or isolation. It is, therefore, a symbolic representation of the relationships between nations. Go is getting increasingly popular around the world, especially in Asian, European and American countries, with many worldwide competitions being held.,,
,,
The game of Go is played on a board. The Go set is comprised of the board, together with 181 black and 180 white stones. The standard board has 19 lines by 19 lines, but 13x13 and 9x9 boards can also be used. However, the 9x9 and 13x13 boards are usually for beginners; more advanced players would prefer the traditional 19x19 board.,,
,,
Compared to International Chess and Chinese Chess, Go has far fewer rules. Yet this allowed for all sorts of moves to be played, so Go can be a more intellectually challenging game than the other two types of Chess. Nonetheless, Go is not a difficult game to learn, so have a fun time playing the game with your friends.,,

Nethack sometimes saves the level on which you die (including your stuff, what killed you, and your ghost) in a ""bones file"".  These files get loaded into later Nethack games.  If you're the only Nethack player on your system you'll only get bones files you created yourself.,,
,,
With Hearse, you can automatically exchange bones files with other Nethack players.  When run it uploads any new bones files it finds on your system, then downloads any bones files the server feels like giving it.  See http://www.argon.org/~roderick/hearse/ for more information.,,
,,
An important thing to note is that by default using Hearse will cause you to end up with more bones than you otherwise would have.  This changes the game's balance and is considered by many players to be a mild form of cheating.  You can address this by turning on the --delete-uploaded option, but the down side is you'll never encounter your own bones files.","role::program, scope::utility, use::downloading, use::gameplaying",http://www.argon.org/~roderick/hearse/,rpg,commandline,https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/hearse,https://screenshots.debian.net/package/hearse,,nan

Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the ""Rope"" or ""Parachute"", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving.,,
,,
A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee, Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).","role::program, uitoolkit::qt, uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application",https://hedgewars.org,strategy,graphical,https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/hedgewars,https://screenshots.debian.net/package/hedgewars,,nan

KildClient is a MUD Client written with the GTK+ windowing toolkit. It supports many common features of other clients, such as triggers, gags, aliases, macros, timers, and much more. But its main feature is the built-in Perl interpreter. You can at any moment execute Perl statements and functions to do things much more powerful than simply sending text the mud. Perl statements can also be run, for example, as the action of a trigger, allowing you to do complex things. Some built-in functions of KildClient allow interaction with the world, such as sending commands to it.,,
,,
KildClient's ANSI support is extensive: it supports not only the common 16 colors, but also support underlined text (singly and doubly), text in italics, text striked through, reverse video and ""hidden"" text. It also supports vt100's line-drawing characters, and xterm's escape sequences for a 256-color mode. All these features make KildClient one of the clients with the most features for displaying the mud output.,,
,,
Kildclient supports the MCCP (Mud Client Compression Protocol) protocol, versions 1 and 2, to reduce the necessary bandwidth.,,

You have to choose very carefully the order in which you visit all the rooms in the huge map if you want to keep your character alive. The map is structured in a main map (called the castle), and 10 submaps (called the worlds). Initially you are in the castle, and you have to find the keys that open the doors that go to each of the worlds. To complete the game, you have to defeat the boss at the end of each one of the 10 worlds. You are free to revisit each world as often as you want, in order to see if you have missed something. To defeat all 10 beasts, you control two characters: Popolon and Aphrodite, and each one has special abilities, i.e. Popolon has a greater ability to jump and Aphrodite is able to dive.","implemented-in::c, role::program, uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application",http://www.braingames.getput.com/mog/,platform,graphical,https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/mazeofgalious,https://screenshots.debian.net/package/mazeofgalious,,nan

NetHack is a wonderfully silly, yet quite addictive, Dungeons & Dragons-style adventure game. You play a character from one of many classes (such as wizard, ranger, or tourist), fighting your way down to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor (try saying THAT one backwards!) for your god. On the way, you might encounter a quantum mechanic or two, or perhaps King Arthur, or - if you're REALLY lucky - the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.,,

Netrek is probably the first video game which can accurately be described as a ""sport"".  It has more in common with basketball than with arcade games or Quake.  Its vast and expanding array of tactics and strategies allows for many different play styles; the best players are the ones who think fastest, not necessarily the ones who twitch most effectively.  It can be enjoyed as a twitch game, since the dogfighting system is extremely robust, but the things that really set Netrek apart from other video games are the team and strategic aspects.  Team play is dynamic and varied, with roles constantly changing as the game state changes.  Strategic play is explored in organized league games; after 6+ years of league play, strategies are still being invented and refined.,,

tome,2.4~0.git.2015.12.29-1.2+b2,non-free,single-player text-based roguelike dungeon simulation game,"single-player text-based roguelike dungeon simulation game,,
Tome, short for Troubles of Middle Earth, is a single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation derived from the game angband, which in turn is derived from the older game Moria, which was in turn based on Rogue. It is often described as a ""roguelike"" game because the look and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue.,,
,,
In tome, the  player may choose from a number of races and classes when creating a character, and then ""run"" that character over a period of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in  the depths of the dungeon.,,
,,
The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so, you will receive the exalted status of ""winner"" and your character may retire.,,
,,
The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need to be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where instead of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities as they become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on their character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of character they play. See the skills help file for details,,
,,
The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has been split  into 4 ""dungeons"", each of which cover a different portion of the dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are actually ""dungeons"" - some are caves, forests, etc.,,
,,
The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very different  magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to undertake a series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer to undertake  the fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice rewards.,,
,,
Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, ""god"" of J.R.R. Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth. Angband is a reference to Morgoth's ""prison of iron.""","role::program, uitoolkit::gtk, uitoolkit::ncurses, uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application",https://github.com/tome2/tome2,rpg,"commandline, graphical",https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/tome,https://screenshots.debian.net/package/tome,,nan

All actions require Time Units to perform. Once a soldier is out of Time Units, he or she can't do anything more until the next turn.
